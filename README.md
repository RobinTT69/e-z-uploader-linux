# E-Z Uploader

#1 Download our MacOS app from the button below
#2 Drag the app to your applications folder
#3 If you recieve an error when running it for the first time open your termincal and run xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/E-Z\ Uploader.app
#4 Enter your API key in the API key box and click save. Once its saved click the "Set Up" button. Your API key can be found on the account page
#5 Now screenshot normally with the default screenshot app. I recommend using https://shottr.cc/ since it doesn't have a delay. If you plan on using a third-party tool like shottr set the save location to the "screenshots" folder in your home directory
